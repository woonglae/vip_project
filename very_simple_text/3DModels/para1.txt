McCloud’s thoughtful and at the same
 time playful approach inspired us to
try to explain a medium in and through
the same medium. What McCloud did for
 comics, we want to do for VR and AR.
At first we imagined that we could
simply create a digital form that
would contain a book’s worth of text
and at the same time be an augmented
or virtual application. But we soon
realized that that would not work.
One reason that McCloud was able to
write a treatise on comics in the form
of a comic is that both a traditional
monograph and a comic exist in the
same medium of ink on paper. Both
consist of text and illustrations,
although in different forms and ratios.
In our case, however, AR and VR cannot
function as reality media on the printed
page; they are born digital media forms.
It is difficult to illustrate AR and VR
in the pages of a printed book, and
equally difficult to incorporate a
lengthy textual discussion in an AR or
VR application.

So while McCloud was able to express
himself in a single medium, we have
to use two separate formats: print
and digital. These two formats enable
us to present reality media from two
perspectives: from the “inside” as well
as the "outside." The purpose of the
digital version is not merely to
illustrate the affordances of the new
media for the reader, but to allow her
to enact or even to inhabit the media.
The printed book provides a perspective
that is the opposite of an immersive
experience of AR and VR: a critical
explanation of these media in the
contexts of media history and their
design aesthetics. The printed version
can also address the making of the digital
version and reflect on the future
potential of the digital book. The printed
book is independent of the digital,
although the two are in dialogue. The
reader will be able to understand the
printed book without using the digital
version, but her understanding will be
enhanced if she experiences both forms.
